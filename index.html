<h3><strong>the career</strong></h3>
<p>
<em>
The series centres on Ben Tennyson, a 10-year-old boy on a summer vacation road trip with his loathsome twin cousin Gwen and their grandfather Max. On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV, Ben finds a mysterious watch-style device named the Omnitrix that attaches itself to his wrist, giving him the ability to transform into various alien life-forms. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies, ranging from aliens such as intergalactic warlord Vilgax, bounty hunter duo Sixsix and Kraab, Ectonurite high king Zs'skayr, criminals such as energy-absorbing 11-year-old delinquent Kevin Levin, mad scientist Doctor Animo, mysterious paramilitary organization the Forever Knights, and supernatural entities such as inter-dimensional sorcerer Hex and his niece Charmcaster, and clown mastermind Zombozo and his Circus Freak Trio.

<h3><strong>his good</strong></h3>
<p>
<em>
After Ben's last battle with Vilgax, which destroyed the Omnitrix, Ben replaces it with the new Ultimatrix that allows him to evolve his alien forms into their ultimate forms. With the recent disclosure of his identity, Ben has become a worldwide celebrity. Meanwhile, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin must stop an Osmosian villain named Aggregor, who hunts aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy and intends to use their powers to achieve the "ultimate prize". Later, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin have to prevent an extradimensional entity called Diagon from taking over the universe.
Ben acquires the new and perfected Omnitrix, which gives him access to a new set of aliens along with all the forms he has assumed prior. After Gwen goes away to college with Kevin accompanying her, Ben pairs up with Rook Blonko, a plumber from the planet Revonnah. He is targeted by an intergalactic huntsman named Khyber, who made a copy of the Omnitrix, the Nemetrix, with the help of mad scientist Dr Psychobos. Both of them are working with an enemy from Ben's past, a Galvanic Mechamorph named Malware. Ben later contends with the Incurseans, Albedo, Zs'Skayr, Dr Psychobos, Charmcaster, the Plumber's Black-Ops Unit (called the "Rooters"), his alternate dimension self Mad Ben, and the Chronosapien Maltruant.
